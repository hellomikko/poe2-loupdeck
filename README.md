# What the hell is Path of Exile 2?

Path of Exile 2 is a new title from Grinding Gear Games. It features a sprawling 6 Act campaign, 12 playable classes, and deep character customization that continues to evolve as you progress toward the endgame. Combat has been designed to incorporate movement and focus on the minute-to-minute gameplay. Once you complete the Acts you can explore Path of Exile 2's endgame. This includes more character customization, crafting, and different league mechanics to farm.

## Disclaimer
This app does not alter the game in any way, thus, does not break Grinding Gear Gaming's Terms & Agreements. And it will most certainly not help you speed level your way to end game ü§£ü¶ô, your on the same struggle bus as we all are, the once used to be speed leveler's. Or so they called us.

I ended up creating a Loupdeck Profile for fun and for myself since I was the type to play the piano while gaming. This brings me back to my World of Warcraft days!

On this repo, is where the project is created and publicly available to download since I do not know where or how to upload sharable Profiles for LoupDeck as there are no instructions on doing so.
So I want to share it with all of you here.

[# Prerequisites](#Prerequisites)

- Be sure to have the [latest LoupDeck Software](https://support.loupedeck.com/announcements) installed in order to use this profile.
- Early Access too Path of Exile 2 from https://steamcommunity.com/app/2694490. If you have XBOX, you still can  use this profile, providing you are using Loupdeck on a PC or Laptop with PoE2 running on the same hardware your Lopupdeck is on. For the PS5 version, I am sorry, I do not own a PS5. Im a PC guy all the way! You are still able to join our community, hang out, [link up with people](https://discord.gg/xxtE98gRe6) to chill and run with if you like üòè. Everyone is welcomed.

# The Loupdeck Profile Wiki
Be sure to check out the wiki for how-to's as far as understanding how to get this profile set up. Its really nothing at all and easy to do providing you have the [#Prerequisites](#Prerequisites) because all it is, is easy access keybinds and other nifty things added.

## What Now?
